# Challenge-4 Javascript Knowledge Quiz

## Description

This project represents a timed Javascript knowledge quiz with multiple-choice questions. The application runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by the Javascript code. When the user clicks the Start Quiz button, a timer starts at 60 seconds and is displayed in the upper corner of the screen. After the user answers a question, the next question is then displayed on the screen. When the user selects an incorrect answer, 10 seconds are deducted from the timer. When the timer reaches 0 seconds or the user has answered all the questions, the quiz ends and the final score (timer) is displayed on the screen. The score represents the number of seconds left at the end of the quiz. 

After completing the quiz, the user is prompted to enter his/her initials, and submit the score. Next, the highscore is displayed on the screen with the user's initials.
